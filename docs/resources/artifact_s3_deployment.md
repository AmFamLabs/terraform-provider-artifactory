# artifactory_artifact_s3_deployment (Resource)


One "deployment" should be made per function, since it is fully managed by the
s3_key, the underlying zip on s3 that more than one function may use will be
deleted. We assume artifactory will have uniqueness on each "repository_path",
the artifact itself, or the basename will be the basename on s3 with
`s3_prefix` like `s3://$S3_PREFIX/$ARTIFACT_BASENAME`.

To put another way - if your function will require a specific version, it will
need to be exposed by Artifactory's path provided as `repository_path` to the
resource.

```terraform
resource "artifactory_artifact_s3_deployment" "test_artifact" {
  repository_path = "lambda/test-1.0.0.zip"
  s3_bucket = "foo-live-bucket"
  s3_prefix = "lambda/deployments"
}

... aws_lambda_function goes here ...
```
